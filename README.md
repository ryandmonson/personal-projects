Personal software projects

This repo contains any of the software projects I'm doing to better learn data science which are outside of my Dataquest project

The first personal project (Good Quotes) was converting quotes from a Google doc to a Pandas dataframe, splitting the Google doc strings into columns and writing the resulting dataframe to a .csv file.

The 2nd personal project (SF Crime Kaggle) was work I did using the San Francisco crime classification data as part of a team Kaggle competition.
