       "110  ...I know many people who believe that being tough is a matter of how loud you raise your voice or how hard you hit the desk.  That’s cowardice. That’s intimidation. But that’s not tough. Real toughness is having high expectations, setting high standards, achieving clarity about goals, and ensuring that employees understand the vision and can connect their work with the well being of the enterprise.  Then it means being there, paying attention, extending yourself, caring about employees, being a resource, and dealing forthrightly with all of the paradoxes in this world.- James Autry                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "111  It is unwise to pay too much, but it is worse to pay too little. When you pay too much, you lose a little money; that is all.  When you pay too little, you sometimes lose everything because the thing you bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do.  The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot.

A healthy organism will withstand such shock more easily than a diseased one; indeed, “healthy” with respect to the organization of an enterprise means the ability to accept change easily and without trauma.  Still, it is the mark of a good surgeon that he does not cut unless necessary.- Peter F.

Only a few, and they are exceptional, can make a journey to wisdom without a teacher. You must have extraordinary passion, patience, and self discipline to make a journey alone. The goals must be understood,and no diversion can be acknowledged or permitted if you are to attain enlightenment within the sphere of a chosen art. This is a very difficult road to travel and not many are made for it. It is frustrating, confusing, very lonely, certainly frightening, and it will sometimes make you think you do not have much sanity left to deal with the everyday surroundings of your world. Also, there is no guarantee that you will attain perfection. It must all come from inside you without any preconceived notions on your part.

Each time we choose to sacrifice the good of the system for one person, or allow an ineffective, outdated legacy practice to continue, we take small steps toward lower and lower standards. When we have a culture that puts quality and environmental attainment at a lower priority than feelings and keeping the status quo, slowly we make the hundreds of decisions that eat away at total performance.... Every week tens, if not hundreds, of little decisions like these are made in a large company. Any one decision will not make or break the system. However, hundreds of decisions being made with a priority on entrenched personnel or ideas rather than the higher goals of continuous improvement will bring the system to its knees over time....In the end, nobody plans to have poor quality or environmental performance.

More commonly, successful people overestimate their responsibility for whatever successes they achieve.- Knowledge at Wharton, “Quality Digest, November 9, 2017”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "413    Whether it is an established industry, government, or religion, the people who hold the power will fight to keep it. They get to choose the direction and will reward those who follow without question. Those who are in charge of established organizations control the resources that enable them to preserve their way of doing things. This is why major corporations love regulation.

       "421    Commanders should be counselled, chiefly, by persons of known talent; by those who have made the art of war their particular study, and whose knowledge is derived from experience; from those who are present at the scene of action, embarked in the same ship, are sharers of the danger.  If, therefore, any one thinks himself qualified to give advice respecting the war which I am to conduct, which may prove advantageous to the public, let him not refuse his assistance to the state, but let him come with me into Macedonia. He shall be furnished with a ship, a horse, a tent; even his travelling charges will be defrayed.  But if he thinks this too much trouble, and prefers the repose of a city life to the toils of war, let him not, on land, assume the office of a pilot. The city, in itself, furnishes abundance of topics for conversation; let it confine its passion for talking within its own precincts, and rest assured that we shall pay no attention to any councils but such as shall be framed within our camp. -General Lucius Aemilius Paulus, surnamed Macedonius, “Livy History of Rome vol. 7, chap 22”.   \n",

       "466   if we were unable to scorn pleasure by the aid of reason and philosophy, we ought to have been very grateful to old age for depriving us of all inclination for that which it was wrong to do.

In a shame culture you know you are good or bad by what your community says about you, by whether it honors or excludes you. … [In the shame culture,] moral life is not built on the continuum of right and wrong; it’s built on the continuum of inclusion and exclusion“… Everybody is perpetually insecure in a moral system based on inclusion and exclusion. There are no permanent standards, just the shifting judgment of the crowd. It is a culture of oversensitivity, overreaction and frequent moral panics, during which everybody feels compelled to go along...“The guilt culture could be harsh, but at least you could hate the sin and still love the sinner.

       "468   We can all acknowledge that a sedentary lifestyle, poor nutrition, and “toxic” habits contribute to abysmal American health care outcomes. But maybe the American attitude toward health care is not the fundamental cause. This attitude might be a reflection of larger social and cultural forces in our country. Americans have long been known for entitlement and a flair for dramatic heroism. Our healthcare system amplifies those traits, with its emphasis on high cost and high intervention care over preventative care and lifestyle changes. We demonize figures of authority and are inherently skeptical of advice from experts. Easily offended, we insist on ensuring comfort rather than knowing truth. Creating cultural change will require far more than simply modifying healthcare incentives. Treating the problem is usually more difficult than treating the symptoms. - David J.

But that’s not tough. Real toughness is having high expectations, setting high standards, achieving clarity about goals, and ensuring that employees understand the vision and can connect their work with the well being of the enterprise.  Then it means being there, paying attention, extending yourself, caring about employees, being a resource, and dealing forthrightly with all of the paradoxes in this world.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "111  It is unwise to pay too much, but it is worse to pay too little. When you pay too much, you lose a little money; that is all.  When you pay too little, you sometimes lose everything because the thing you bought was incapable of doing the thing it was bought to do.  The common law of business balance prohibits paying a little and getting a lot. It can’t be done. If you deal with the lowest bidder, it is well to add something for the risk you run, and if you do that you will have enough to pay for something better.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",

       "456   Progressive politics is distinguishable from religious fundamentalism only in that it resembles a quasi pagan hodgepodge of cults and deities. At its center is submission to the benevolence, wisdom, and sacred power of the State. There is a Cult of Equality and a Diversity Mystery Rite. There are not one, but two versions of original sin; racism and crimes against Gaia, as well as an End Times mania connected with the second. There is a canon of sacred texts whose dogma brooks no dissent. There are witch trials and rituals of confession and expiation for the sin of Whiteness. There are saints and martyrs, priests and heretics, a Satan, and briefly a Messiah. The euphoria of 2008 and the apocalyptic panic of 2016 are two sides of the same essentially religious experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

But maybe the American attitude toward health care is not the fundamental cause. This attitude might be a reflection of larger social and cultural forces in our country. Americans have long been known for entitlement and a flair for dramatic heroism. Our healthcare system amplifies those traits, with its emphasis on high cost and high intervention care over preventative care and lifestyle changes. We demonize figures of authority and are inherently skeptical of advice from experts. Easily offended, we insist on ensuring comfort rather than knowing truth.
