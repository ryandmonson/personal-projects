This is a very difficult road to travel and not many are made for it. It is frustrating, confusing, very lonely, certainly frightening, and it will sometimes make you think you do not have much sanity left to deal with the everyday surroundings of your world.

Each time we choose to sacrifice the good of the system for one person, or allow an ineffective, outdated legacy practice to continue, we take small steps toward lower and lower standards.

Every week tens, if not hundreds, of little decisions like these are made in a large company. Any one decision will not make or break the system.

There are not one, but two versions of original sin; racism and crimes against Gaia, as well as an End Times mania connected with the second. There is a canon of sacred texts whose dogma brooks no dissent. There are witch trials and rituals of confession and expiation for the sin of Whiteness. There are saints and martyrs, priests and heretics, a Satan, and briefly a Messiah.

There are no permanent standards, just the shifting judgment of the crowd. It is a culture of oversensitivity, overreaction and frequent moral panics, during which everybody feels compelled to go along...“The guilt culture could be harsh, but at least you could hate the sin and still love the sinner.

468," We can all acknowledge that a sedentary lifestyle, poor nutrition, and “toxic” habits contribute to abysmal American health care outcomes. But maybe the American attitude toward health care is not the fundamental cause. This attitude might be a reflection of larger social and cultural forces in our country. Americans have long been known for entitlement and a flair for dramatic heroism. Our healthcare system amplifies those traits, with its emphasis on high cost and high intervention care over preventative care and lifestyle changes. We demonize figures of authority and are inherently skeptical of advice from experts. Easily offended, we insist on ensuring comfort rather than knowing truth. Creating cultural change will require far more than simply modifying healthcare incentives. Treating the problem is usually more difficult than treating the symptoms. ","- David J.

If there be not, we are in a wretched situation. No theoretical checks—no form of government can render us secure. To suppose that any form of government will secure liberty or happiness without any virtue in the people, is a chimerical idea.”","- James Madison, “Virginia Convention to ratify Constitution, Friday June 20 1788, Elliots Debates”."
476," Wherefore, I must again and again repeat, you must satisfy your judgment before engaging your affections: not love first and judge afterwards. We suffer from carelessness in many of our undertakings: in none more than in selecting and cultivating our friends. ","- Cicero, “On Friendship”"
477," Compliance gets us friends, plain speaking hate. ","- Terence, “quoted by Cicero in ‘On Friendship’”"
478,"  There are people who owe more to bitter enemies than to apparently pleasant friends: the former often speak the truth, the latter never. ","- Cato, “quoted by Cicero in One Friendship’”"
479," To be conservative, then, is to prefer the familiar to the unknown, to prefer the tried to the untried, fact to mystery, the actual to the possible, the limited to the unbounded, the near to the distant, the sufficient to the superabundant, the convenient to the perfect, present laughter to Utopian bliss. Familiar relationships and loyalties will be preferred to the allure of more profitable attachments; to acquire and to enlarge will be less important than to keep, to cultivate and to enjoy; the grief of loss will be more acute than the excitement of novelty or promise. ","- Michael Oakeshott "" On Being Conservative"""
